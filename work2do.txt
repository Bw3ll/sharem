unencrypted = decoder + encoded, the entire thing

disassembly==Found

	old=rawdata2
	rawdata2=unencrypted



	decoderStub finder-->   0 - 20 bytes
	unecrypted --> 21- 150 (end)


combine them-->
	decoderstub + unecrypted

split them in half
decoder stub
	by itself

unecnrypted Body
	only after the decoder stub


save old rawdata2
 ----for testing purposes, since we do know austin's variable, we could just set New Thing = old shellcode + old shellode (double size, different offsets)
rawData2 = New Thing
	unencryptedBody = rawdata2+rawdata2
	unecrypted=rawdata2+rawdta2+rawdata2

the beginning
rawdata2=full thing, encoded
unencrypted, full thing, decoded
decoder stub - just a small part
unecnryptedBody= body, decoded
boolean if shellcode is decoded successfully - false, by default, true if found

	for your testing purposes, since you do not have it, just go unecrypted = Some Other Bytes in memory (could be same shellcode)


------> for my testing, I would do a slice of the original, and the concatenate it with a slice of the the decoded --> i just manually found the offsets- no automation--my result was one that had unecrypted of both
		better option is to have decoder stub, + unecrypted body


currently have two
rawdata
unecrypted   --  this will encrypt the decoder stub by default
	if it does xor 3, xor 3, add 4 -- then to undo it, it will do the opposite, to every byte
+ add two more


----
Austin responsible for 
	creating unecrypted body, decoder stub, unecyrpted

---
our work
	maybe create submenu/menu option to do "our operations" (push ret, etc)
	can provide option to make rawdata = unecrypted, or unecrypted body
		may need both - if it cannot find decoder stub
		unecrypted body is the default

	Need functionality to make this work
	store old rawdata2 somewhere, like old rawdata2
		give option to restore it to the way before, rawdata=oldRawData


	we want some boolean value that indicates if Unencrypted is found - Austin can be responsible for setting it.

	when we print disassembly, we will want to do disassembly of decoder stub + unencrypted
		i might have you do this, but for now, let's say it is Bramwell's responsiblity




a - Analyze deobfuscated shellcode

---> lead to its own submenu
	

	submenu displays if successfully Deobufsucated

Deobfuscated? [NO, Success] [x]
	communicate if successfully done

options like
	? - Use decoded body as raw data
	? - Use decoded shellcode as raw data 
		Note: This includes decoder stub and body)

Note: You will need to go to main menu to analyze the deobfuscated shellcode.
